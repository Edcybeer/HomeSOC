# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Homelab: Penetration Testing & SOC Environment

Welcome to my cybersecurity homelab project! This is a hands-on, end-to-end lab environment designed to simulate real-world cybersecurity operations. From penetration testing to deploying a mini Security Operations Center (SOC), this lab demonstrates the process of building, monitoring, and securing IT infrastructure—all from scratch.

# 🚀 Project Highlights

🔐 **Penetration Testing Lab Setup**  
📡 **Network Segmentation with pfSense**  
🕵️ **Centralized Log Monitoring with Splunk**  
🖥️ **Windows Server Hardening & Active Directory Configuration**  
🔄 **Simulated Enterprise-Grade Threat Detection**

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **pfSense** – Firewall & network traffic control  
- **Splunk** – Log aggregation & analysis  
- **Windows Server** – Domain Controller, AD setup, Group Policy  
- **Kali Linux** – Penetration testing and offensive tools  
- **VirtualBox / VMware** – Virtualization platform

# 🧠 Why This Lab?

In cybersecurity, practice is everything. This project was born out of the need to build a secure, testable, and realistic environment to explore both offensive and defensive security techniques. The lab provides the foundation for real-world skill-building in a safe and controlled setup.
